## [The plan for Majestic v1](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic/issues/50)

## What is Majestic?

Majestic is an electron app that provides a UI for running tests with Jest. Jest CLI itself provides one of the best testing experiences available today. But Majestic humbly tries to expand upon it by providing a rich UI to be used during the dev/test loop.

## Features

* Run the whole project, a file or a particular test with a click
* Watch the whole project, a file or a test
* Update specific snapshots with a click
* Inline coverage reports
* Zero configuration (Sorry, I had to)
* Support for typescript projects
* Support for Create-React-App out of the box
* Quick search to search across all your test (It) statements
* Failure summary shows all test failtures in a single screen. Useful when you have failures across multiple files.
* Locate a specific test in your editor with the click of a button
* Debug in VSCode with a click
* Console.log() would show up on the UI

## Download the app

#### macOS

[**Download**](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic/releases/latest) the `.dmg` file.

Or with [Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io): `$ brew cask install majestic`

#### Windows

[**Download**](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic/releases/latest) the `.exe` file.

### External Jest configuration file

Ok, I lied partially about the zero config part.

Majestic is a zero config tool if you keep all your jest configuration in the `package.json` file.

If you have an external `jest` config file, you should have a `jestConfig` key in the `package.json` pointing to the file as shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-proj",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "..",
  "majestic": {
    "jestConfig": "./jest-custom.config.js"
  }
}
```

### Debug in VS Code

* Install the [VSCode majestic extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Raathigeshan.majestic)
* Open the Project in VS Code
* Open the same project in Majestic
* Click the debug button on the test you want to debug

### Enabling coverage report

Majestic displays coverage reports generated by Jest. So make sure to have HTML coverage report configured so Majestic can display them.

#### Configuring Jest with Html coverage report

It's really simple.

```json
{
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageReporters": ["html"]
}
```

### Configuring coverage in a create-react-app project

```diff
- "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
+ "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom --coverage",
```

## Using custom run script

If you want to provide additional parameters to jest, you can define a custom run script in the package.json file as below.

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-proj",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "..",
  "majestic": {
    "runScript": "jest --silent"
  }
}
```

## Contribute

Majestic relies on [`jest-editor-support`](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/jest-editor-support), a module from jest, which allows the app to execute jest programmatically.

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/jest.git
cd jest
yarn install

# link jest-editor-support
cd packages/jest-editor-support
yarn link
```

Now let's setup majestic.

```
git clone https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic.git
cd majestic/app

# this would install and would do a yarn link for jest-editor-support
yarn install

# start the app
yarn dev
```

To use react dev tools, you can use [electron-react-devtools](https://github.com/firejune/electron-react-devtools), which should already be installed. When you open devtools, type the following into the console:

```javascript
require("electron-react-devtools").install();
```

And then simply refresh (F5). You'll now see a React tab in dev tools. Happy debugging!
