**Debugging tests in VS Code**

Majestic also got a companion VS Code extension. If you install the extension, you would be able to debug tests in VS Code by clicking a button on Majestic UI.

* Go to your extensions tab in VS Code, search and install the **majestic** extension
* Now if you have the same project open in VS Code and Majestic, each tests will have their own **debug in VS-Code** button.
* But a **debugger** statement in your test and click the button on the test and it will start a debugging session in VS Code.
